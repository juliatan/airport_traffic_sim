Airport Traffic Simulator
=========================

This was the challenge set at the end of Week 3 at Makers Academy.

The objective was to write Ruby code to control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off. 

<b>Classes</b>
- Plane (with a flying or landed state)
- Airport (with maximum capacity)

<b>Modules</b>
- Weather (randomly generates either a sunny or stormy state)

Technologies used

* Ruby
* RSpec

How to use
